There are performance problems (exponential blowup in certain cases)
with the way operand type is currently being determined for operator
applications. It would be better to parse the AST when searching for
operand type, and memoise all operand types inferred on the way. It
will not be necessary to search under binders, since functions and
arrows are base cases for this operand type search.
